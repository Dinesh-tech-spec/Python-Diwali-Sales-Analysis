# Python-Diwali-Sales-Analysis

I'm excited to share my latest data analysis project: "Diwali Sales Analysis", where I explored festive season sales data to uncover key consumer insights and business opportunities.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Cleaned and preprocessed raw sales data using Pandas

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify top-selling categories, customer demographics, and spending patterns

Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Derived actionable findings to help businesses optimize product targeting and marketing strategies during the festive season

📈 Key Insights:

Men aged 26-35 from Tier 1 cities were the top buyers

Most spending occurred on electronics and clothing

Marital status and occupation had significant influence on spending behavior

🛠️ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

💡 This project helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling — all crucial for driving data-driven decisions.
